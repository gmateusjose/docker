# Dockerfile

Dockerfiles are files that hold what types of configurations we do want in our Docker Images. This is a source for automatization of execution of tasks. When we create a new container from an image, Docker mounts the root filesystem (readonly, unix-like with directories like `/dev`, `/proc`, `/bin`, `/lib`, `/usr`, `/tmp`, `/etc`). And anything we install in the image will be installed on top of this image (only to preserve the base image). And on top of everything we create our containers with everything that we need installed. It's important to observe that Docker images can exist without containers, although containers need a docker image to exists. In addition to that we also could have many containers running on top of an image.

We use the command `docker build` to create an image from this Dockerfile, and use the `docker create` to create a container on top of an image. Although this type of dependency is true, we can also take an snapshot of a container and transforms it into an docker image.
